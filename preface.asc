== Preface

This book is about Linux kernel networking internals and programming interfaces. While there are other books on Linux kernel and Linux kernel networking, this book attempts to explain in detail how packets arriving on the network hardware traverse through the kernel to userspace and back. That is, this book covers network hardware architecture basics, network device driver architecture, network protocol implementations, and userspace interfaces such as epoll.

=== Intended Audience

This book is intended for systems programmers and application developers who are interested in how networking support is implemented in the Linux kernel and how to build high-performance networking applications. The book assumes basic knowledge of the C programming language, Linux kernel architecture, and TCP/IP.

If you are one of the following, this book is for you:

* a kernel developer who is, for example, tasked with implementing a network device driver
* an application developer who wants to optimize their application for throughput or low-latency
