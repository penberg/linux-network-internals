=== About This Book

This book is about Linux kernel networking internals and programming interfaces. Specifically, this book attempts to explain in detail how packets arriving on the network hardware traverse through the kernel to userspace and back. The book covers network hardware architecture basics, network device driver architecture, network protocol implementations, and userspace interfaces such as epoll. The goal is to give readers in-depth understaning of the Linux networking stack so that they can build high-performance networking systems and applications.

=== Intended Audience

This book is intended for systems programmers and application developers who are interested in how networking support is implemented in the Linux kernel and how to build high-performance networking applications. The book assumes basic knowledge of the C programming language, Linux kernel architecture, and TCP/IP.

If you are one of the following, this book is for you:

* a kernel developer who is, for example, implementing a network device driver
* an application developer who wants to optimize their application for high throughput or low-latency
* a developer who wants to understand how packets flow through the Linux network stack from network hardware to userspace
